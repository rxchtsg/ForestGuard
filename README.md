# ForestGuard
ForestGuard helps detect wildfires early, before they grow out of control. It combines real time sensor data, weather conditions and satellite imagery to spot unusual heat and fire risks as they start to form. Users receive simple, instant alerts and a clear view of where danger is building, so they can act quickly and reduce damage. The goal is straightforward: protect forests, wildlife and nearby communities by catching problems early instead of reacting too late.

The documentation explains how to set up ForestGuard, connect sensors or data sources, understand the dashboard and use the system to monitor and respond to fire risks in real time.
